Launcher-Android
---------------------
A small Android application to serve as a launcher/testbed for the Readium SDK. 

How to get source from github
-------------------------------
 git clone --recursive https://github.com/readium/SDKLauncher-Android.git

See a document on how to build the SDK and Launcher on Android [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ebFQ-8BGoiamKO4K0ZiL1nH6b8wulJ-ORyZKiDEYi-8/edit)


Test LCP
--------

We provide in this repository an LCP encrypted epub : epub-samples/wasteland-test.lcpl
You can push this book in the /sdcard/epubtest directory on your device

This license has been generated by the EDRLab test license server, for the user edrlab-tester, with a hint "Your favorite Lab?"
To decrypt the epub publication associated with this license, you will be required to enter the following passphrase: "EDRLab" (without quotes).

To test your newly compiled app, you need more sample content. EDRLab has setup a test license server, at rcs-test.edrlab.org/10013/. Create a user, then "add" a purchase (top right in the purchase panel). In the purchases panel, go to the status of your purchase, and choose LCPL -> you've got a license. Test it with your app.


Debug C++ code on Android Studio 2
----------------------------------

Gradle experimental build plugin and Android Studio 2 are required to debug C++ code.
By default the project uses stable version of gradle plugin but you can switch easily to the experimental one by adding the following line to local.properties file:
````
readium.ndk_debug=true
````

This settings will switch the build system to the gradle experimental version and allow you to debug, add breakpoints on the C++ code.

You must be careful that if you switch from the stable to the experimental version, you have first to delete all intermediate build files in:
- Platform/Android/epub3/build
- Platform/Android/include
- Platform/Android/obj
- Platform/Android/libs

If you forget to delete these files, the application will crash because of bad version of shared and static libraries.
